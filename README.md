# Shopping-cart-Nodejs

I recently created a robust e-commerce platform using Node.js and Express, integrating it with MongoDB as the database. The application allows for seamless management of shopping carts, product inventory, and user authentication. With a focus on scalability and performance, I implemented a streamlined checkout process and real-time updates for order tracking. This project not only enhanced my proficiency in JavaScript, but also provided me with hands-on experience in developing secure and efficient web applications.
